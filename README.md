# simple_epi_calculations

This repo will contain very simple calculations and outputs that may be useful in COVID-19 modelling and planning.  Thes should be used with caution - I will try as far as possible to highlight the limitations of the calculations uploaded here.  This repo so far contains:

- Simple estimates of the number of students who might be arriving at HE providers in the UK form ENglish regions  testing positive for COVID-19, as well as those testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies.
